<DB00006>,<Bivalirudin>,<approved;;investigational>,<Bivalirudin is a synthetic 20 residue peptide (thrombin inhibitor) which reversibly inhibits thrombin. Once bound to the active site, thrombin cannot activate fibrinogen into fibrin, the crucial step in the formation of thrombus. It is administered intravenously. Because it can cause blood stagnation, it is important to monitor changes in hematocrit, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio and blood pressure.>,<CC[C@H](C)[C@H](NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(O)=O)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(O)=O)NC(=O)[C@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(=O)[C@H](CC(O)=O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@H](CC(N)=O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCN1C(=O)[C@H](CCCNC(N)=N)NC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCN1C(=O)[C@H](N)CC1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(O)=O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(O)=O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC1=CC=C(O)C=C1)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(C)C)C(O)=O>,<C98H138N24O33>,<Bivalirudin;;Bivalirudina;;Bivalirudinum>,<Angiomax@@Sandoz

Gramcidins are 15 residue peptides with alternating D and L amino acids, which assemble inside of the hydrophobic interior of the cellular lipid bilayer to form a -helix. Active against most Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative organisms, Gramicidin D is used primarily as a topical antibiotic and is also found in Polysporin ophthalmic

<DB00035>,<Desmopressin>,<approved>,<Desmopressin (dDAVP), a synthetic analogue of 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH), is an antidiuretic peptide drug modified by deamination of 1-cysteine and substitution of 8-L-arginine by 8-D-arginine. ADH is an endogenous pituitary hormone that has a crucial role in the control of the water content in the body. Upon release from the stimulation of increased plasma osmolarity or decreased circulating blood volume, ADH mainly acts on the cells of the distal part of the nephron and the collecting tubules in the kidney . The hormone interacts with V1, V2 or V3 receptors with differing signal cascade systems.Desmopressin displays enhanced antidiuretic potency, fewer pressor effects due to V2-selective actions, and a prolonged half-life and duration of action compared to endogenous ADH . It has been employed clinically since 1972 and is available in various formulations including intranasal solution, intravenous solution, oral tablet and oral lyophilisate . Desmopressin is indicated for the treatment of polyuric conditions including primary nocturnal enuresis, nocturia, and diabetes insipidus. It was also newly approved for the treatment of mild classical hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease for minor surgeries. The active ingredient in most formulations is desmopressin acetate. Nocdurna, or desmopressin acetate, was approved by the FDA on June 21st, 2018 for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in adults. It is available as a sublingual tablet.>,<NC(=O)CC[C@@H]1NC(=O)[C@H](CC2=CC=CC=C2)NC(=O)[C@H](CC2=CC=C(O)C=C2)NC(=O)CCSSC[C@H](NC(=O)[C@H](CC(N)=O)NC1=O)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@@H](CCCNC(N)=N)C(=O)NCC(N)=O>,<C46H64N14O12S2>,<1-(3-mercaptopropionic acid)-8-D-arginine-vasopressin;;1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin;;1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin;;dDAVP;;Desmopresina;;Desmopressin;;Desmopressine;;Desmopressinum>,<Ddavp@@Sanofi Aventis;;Ddavp@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Ddavp@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;Ddavp@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Ddavp Inj 4mcg/ml@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;Ddavp Melt@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;DDAVP Rhinal Tube@@Sanofi Aventis;;Ddavp Rhinyle@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;Ddavp Spray@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;Ddavp Tablets 0.1mg@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;Ddavp Tablets 0.2mg@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;Desmopressin@@Meliapharm Inc;;Desmopressin@@Aa Pharma Inc;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Watson Pharmaceuticals;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Ncs Health Care Of Ky, Inc Dba Vangard Labs;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Barr Laboratories;;Desmopressin Acetate@@bryant ranch prepack;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Av Kare, Inc.;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Amerincan Health Packaging;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Blue Point Laboratories;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Amring Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Apotex Corporation;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Teva;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Mylan Institutional;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Carilion Materials Management;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Sagent Pharmaceuticals;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Prasco, Laboratories;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Heritage;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc.;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Actavis Pharma, Inc.;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Cadila Healthcare Limited;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc.;;Desmopressin Acetate@@NorthStar Rx LLC;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc.,Usa;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Bauch & Lomb Incorporated;;Desmopressin Acetate@@AvPAK;;Desmopressin Acetate@@KVK-Tech, Inc.;;Desmopressin acetate@@Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc.;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Hospira, Inc.;;Desmopressin Acetate@@Impax Generics;;Desmopressin Acetate@@American Health Packaging;;Desmopressin Spray@@Aa Pharma Inc;;Desmopressin Tablets@@Rainbow Pharmaceuticals Inc;;Minirin@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;Nocdurna@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;Nocdurna@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Noctiva@@Avadel Specialty Pharmaceuticals, Llc;;Nu-desmopressin Spray@@Nu Pharm Inc;;Octostim Liq Inj. 15mcg/ml@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;Octostim Spray@@Ferring Pharmaceuticals;;PMS-desmopressin@@Pharmascience Inc;;Stimate@@Csl Behring;;Stimate@@CSL BEHRING LLC;;Teva-desmopressin@@Teva>,<ENR1LLB0FP>,<16679-58-6>,<Intravenous TDLo in humans is reported to be 0.3 g/kg/10M .

<DB00050>,<Cetrorelix>,<approved;;investigational>,<Cetrorelix is a man-made hormone that blocks the effects of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH). GnRH controls another hormone that is called luteinizing hormone (LH), which is the hormone that starts ovulation during the menstrual cycle. When undergoing hormone treatment sometimes premature ovulation can occur, leading to eggs that are not ready for fertilization to be released. Cetrorelix does not allow the premature release of these eggs to occur.>,<CC(C)C[C@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](CCCNC(N)=O)NC(=O)[C@H](CC1=CC=C(O)C=C1)NC(=O)[C@H](CO)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC1=CN=CC=C1)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC1=CC=C(Cl)C=C1)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC1=CC2=CC=CC=C2C=C1)NC(C)=O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCCNC(N)=N)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@H](C)C(N)=O>,<C70H92ClN17O14>,<Cetrorelix;;Cetrorelixum>,<Cetrotide@@Merck Serono Europe Limited;;Cetrotide@@Emd Serono, A Division Of Emd Inc., Canada;;Cetrotide@@EMD Serono, Inc.>,<OON1HFZ4BA>,<120287-85-6>,<Not Available>,<Not Available>,<Not Available>,<25074887>,<46505494>
<DB00080>,<Daptomycin>,<approved;;investigational>,<Daptomycin is a naturally-occurring lipopeptide antibiotic that kills susceptible gram positive bacteria by disrupting their membrane potential. It is found in the soil bacterium called <i>Streptomyces roseosporus</i>. Antibiotics are used in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria. They work by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. Daptomycin will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections. It was approved in September 2003 for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections. It has a safety profile similar to other agents commonly administered to treat gram-positive infections.>,<CCCCCCCCCC(=O)N[C@@H](CC1=CNC2=C1C=CC=C2)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(N)=O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(O)=O)C(=O)N[C@H]1[C@@H](C)OC(=O)[C@H](CC(=O)C2=C(N)C=CC=C2)NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](CO)NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@H](CC(O)=O)NC(=O)[C@@H](C)NC(=O)[C@H](CC(O)=O)NC(=O)[C@H](CCCN)NC(=O)CNC1=O)[C@H](C)CC(O)=O>,<C72H101N17O26>,<daptomicina;;Daptomycin>,<Cubicin@@Merck

Mild, transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, peripheral vascular thrombosis, itching, transitory exanthema, a feeling of swelling of entire body, pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure in early treatment stages, anaphylactic shock and death have been observed after vitamin B12 administration .**Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis**Long term studies in animals examining the carcinogenic potential of any of the vitamin B12 formulations have not completed to date.  There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that vitamin B12 has carcinogenic potential. Perniciousanemia is known to be associated with an increased incidence of stomach carcinoma, however, this malignancy has been attributed to the underlying cause of pernicious anemia and has not been found to be related to treatment with vitamin B12 [FDA label].**Use in pregnancy** No adverse effects have been reported with ingestion of normal daily requirements during pregnancy . **A note on the use of the nasal spray in pregnancy**Although vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy, it is currently unknown whether the nasal spray form can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. The nasal spray form should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed, as it is considered a pregnancy category C drug in this form. Sufficient well-controlled studies have not been done to this date in pregnant women [FDA label].**Use in lactation**Vitamin B12 has been found distributed into the milk of nursing women in concentrations similar to the maternal blood vitamin B12 concentrations.

<DB00123>,<L-Lysine>,<approved;;nutraceutical>,<L-Lysine (abbreviated as Lys or K) is an a-amino acid with the chemical formula HO2CCH(NH2)(CH2)4NH2. This amino acid is an essential amino acid, which means that humans cannot synthesize it. Its codons are AAA and AAG. L-Lysine is a base, as are arginine and histidine. The e-amino group acts as a site for hydrogen binding and a general base in catalysis. Common posttranslational modifications include methylation of the e-amino group, giving methyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethyllysine. The latter occurs in calmodulin. Other posttranslational modifications include acetylation. Collagen contains hydroxylysine which is derived from lysine by lysyl hydroxylase. O-Glycosylation of lysine residues in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus is used to mark certain proteins for secretion from the cell.>,<NCCCC[C@H](N)C(O)=O>,<C6H14N2O2>,<(S)-2,6-diaminohexanoic acid;;(S)-lysine;;(S)-a,e-diaminocaproic acid;;6-ammonio-L-norleucine;;L-2,6-Diaminocaproic acid;;L-lys;;L-Lysin;;LYS;;Lysina;;Lysine;;Lysine acid;;Lysinum>,<2.5% Travasol Amino Acid Injection With Electrolytes In 10% Dextrose@@Baxter Corporation Clintec Nutrition Division;;2.5% Travasol Amino Acid Injection With Electrolytes In 10% Dextrose Clinimix@@Baxter Corporation Clintec Nutrition Division;;2.5% Travasol Amino Acid Injection Without Electrolytes In 10% Dextrose Quickmix@@Baxter Corporation Clintec Nutrition Division;;2.5%travasol Amino Acid InJ.W.eleC.W.25%dex@@Clintec Nutrition Company;;2.75% Travas.

<DB00136>,<Calcitriol>,<approved;;nutraceutical>,<Calcitriol is an active metabolite of vitamin D with 3 hydroxyl (OH) groups and is commonly referred to as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>. It is produced in the body after series of conversion steps of 7-dehydrocholesterol from exposure to UV light. 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to  (vitamin D3) in the skin, which is then converted to  in the liver and kidneys.  undergoes hydroxylation to form calcitriol via 1a-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) activity . Calcitriol is considered to be the most potent metabolite of vitamin D in humans . Renal production of calcitriol is stimulated in response to PTH, low calcium and low phosphate . Calcitriol plays a role in plasma calcium regulation in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) by enhancing absorption of dietary calcium and phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract, promoting renal tubular reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys, and stimulating the release of calcium stores from the skeletal system. In addition to promoting fatty acid synthesis and inhibiting lipolysis, calcitriol has been demonstrated to increase energy efficiency by suppressing UCP2 expression, which is modulated by signaling pathways of classical nuclear receptors (nVDR), where calcitriol acts as a natural ligand . There is also evidence that calcitriol modulates the action of cytokines and may regulate immune and inflammatory response, cell turnover, cell differentiation . Administered orally and intravenously, calcitriol is commonly used as a medication in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone disease, hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis, and osteoporosis. It is also available in topical form for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis in adults. Calcitriol is marketed under various trade names including Rocaltrol (Roche), Calcijex (Abbott) and Decostriol (Mibe, Jesalis).>,<C[C@H](CCCC(C)(C)O)[C@@]1([H])CC[C@@]2([H])\C(CCC[C@]12C)=C\C=C1\C[C@@H](O)C[C@H](O)C1=C>,<C27H44O3>,<(1S,3R,5Z,7E)-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10-triene-1,3,25-triol;;(1a,3,5Z,7E)-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10(19)-triene-1,3,25-triol;;(5Z,7E)-(1S,3R)-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10(19)-triene-1,3,25-triol;;1-alpha-25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3;;1,25-DHCC;;1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol;;1a,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol;;1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3;;1a,25(OH)2D3;;Calcitriol;;Calcitriolum>,<Calcijex@@Abbvie;;Calcitriol@@NEPHRX, LLC;;Calcitriol@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Calcitriol@@West Ward Pharmaceutical;;Calcitriol@@Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc.;;Calcitriol@@Dispensing Solutions, Inc.;;Calcitriol@@Carilion Materials Management;;Calcitriol@@Aphena Pharma Solutions Tennessee, Inc.;;Calcitriol@@Amerincan Health Packaging;;Calcitriol@@Teva;;Calcitriol@@West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp.;;Calcitriol@@Fresenius Kabi;;Calcitriol@@Cardinal Health;;Calcitriol@@Golden State Medical Supply;;Calcitriol@@Akorn;;Calcitriol@@American Regent;;Calcitriol@@bryant ranch prepack;;Calcitriol@@Avera McKennan Hospital;;Calcitriol@@Atlantic Biologicals Corps.;;Calcitriol@@Bionpharma Inc.;;Calcitriol@@Nucare Pharmaceuticals,inc.;;Calcitriol@@Heritage;;Calcitriol@@Strides Shasun Limited;;Calcitriol@@Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc.;;Calcitriol@@AMERICAN REGENT, INC.;;Calcitriol@@Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.;;Calcitriol@@KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITALS;;Calcitriol@@Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC;;Calcitriol@@Heritage Pharmaceuticals Inc;;Calcitriol@@Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Calcitriol@@Perrigo New York Inc;;Calcitriol@@American Health Packaging;;Calcitriol@@Golden State Medical Supply Inc.;;Calcitriol@@Atlantic Biologicals Corp.;;Calcitriol Injection@@Fresenius Kabi;;Calcitriol Injection USP@@Sterimax Inc;;Calcitriol-odan@@Odan Laboratories Ltd;;Rocaltrol@@Roche Pharmaceuticals;;Rocaltrol@@Kaiser Foundations Hospitals;;Rocaltrol@@Aphena Pharma Solutions Tennessee, Inc.;;Rocaltrol@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Rocaltrol@@Validus Pharmaceuticals;;Rocaltrol Cap 0.25mcg@@Hoffmann La Roche;;Rocaltrol Cap 0.5mcg@@Hoffmann La Roche;;Rocaltrol Oral Solution 1mcg/ml@@Hoffmann La Roche;;Silkis@@Galderma;;Taro-calcitriol@@Taro Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Validerm@@Accumix Pharmaceuticals;;Vectical@@Galderma>,<FXC9231JVH>,<32222-06-3>,<LD<sub>50</sub> (oral, rat) = 620 &mu;g/kg; LD<sub>50</sub> (intraperitoneal, rat) > 5 mg/kg .Symptoms of calcitriol toxicity mirrors the early and late signs and symptoms of vitamin D intoxication associated with hypercalcemia .

In apoptosis, phosphatidyl serine is transferred to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This is part of the process by which the cell is targeted for phagocytosis. PS has been shown to slow cognitive decline in animal models. PS has been investigated in a small number of double-blind placebo trials and has been shown to increase memory performance in the elderly.

<DB00152>,<Thiamine>,<approved;;investigational;;nutraceutical;;vet_approved>,<Thiamine or thiamin, also known as vitamin B1, is a colorless compound with the chemical formula C12H17N4OS. It is soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. Thiamine decomposes if heated. Thiamine was first discovered by Umetaro Suzuki in Japan when researching how rice bran cured patients of Beriberi. Thiamine plays a key role in intracellular glucose metabolism and it is thought that thiamine inhibits the effect of glucose and insulin on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Thiamine plays an important role in helping the body convert carbohydrates and fat into energy. It is essential for normal growth and development and helps to maintain proper functioning of the heart and the nervous and digestive systems. Thiamine cannot be stored in the body; however, once absorbed, the vitamin is concentrated in muscle tissue.>,<CC1=C(CCO)SC=[N+]1CC1=CN=C(C)N=C1N>,<C12H17N4OS>,<Aneurin;;Antiberiberi factor;;Thiamin;;thiamine;;thiamine(1+);;thiamine(1+) ion;;thiaminium;;tiamina;;Vitamin B1>,<24 Multivitamins + Minerals@@Stanley Pharmaceuticals, A Division Of Vita Health Products Inc.;;50 Plus@@Quest Vitamins A Div Of Purity Life Health Products;;50 Plus Multiple Vitamins & Minerals@@Gfr Pharma Ltd.;;Acti-MN + B1 + C Caplet@@Acti Form Ltd.;;Acti-thiamine Caplet 100mg@@Acti Form Ltd.;;Active FE@@Gm Pharmaceuticals;;Active FE@@Allegis Pharmaceuticals, LLC;;Active OB@@Gm Pharmaceuticals;;Adult Infuvite Multiple Vitamins@@Sandoz Inc;;Advanced B & T Formula@@Nutraceutical Corporation;;Alertonic@@Odan Laboratories Ltd;;Alertonic@@Merrell Pharms Inc., Division Of Merrell Dow (Can);;Allbee C 800 Tab@@Whitehall Robins Inc.;;Allbee With C 550 Cap@@Whitehall Robins Inc.;;Allbee With Vitamin C Cap@@Whitehall Robins Inc.;;Alsimine W Vitamins A D@@Alsi Cie Ltee;;Am Caps@@New Vision Nutritionals Company;;Animal Shapes@@Central Texas Community Health Centers;;Animal Shapes w/Iron Chewtabs@@Central Texas Community Health Centers;;Antlerviron@@Classical Remedia Ltd;;Appedrine@@Chattem, Inc.;;Azesco@@Solubiomix;;B 50 Capsules@@Rheingold Food International Ltd.;;B 6 Plus@@Anabolic Laboratories Inc.;;B C Antistress Cap@@Les Laboratoires Bio Sant Inc.;;B Complex 25mg Vitamin Supplement@@Garden State Nutritionals;;B Complex 50 Vitamin Cap@@Bioforce Canada Inc.;;B Complex 50+ Caplet@@Health Wise Nutrition Inc.;;B Complex 500 Tab@@Nobel Pharm Enr.;;B Complex Plus C 300mg Tab@@Nutricorp International;;B Complex Tablets@@Golden Neo Life Diamite International, Limited;;B Complex W C and B12 Inj@@E L Stickley And Co Ltd.;;B Complex W C Forte Cap@@Everest Pharmaceuticals Ltd.;;B Complex W Vit C W Non-med Yeast&liver Tab@@Pharmavite;;B Complex W Vitamin C Fortis Cap@@Shoppers Drug Mart Inc.;;B Complex With C 300mg@@Vita Health Products Inc;;B Complex With C 300mg Tab@@Pharmavite;;B Complex With C 550mg@@Vita Health Products Inc;;B Compound 50mg Tab@@Gahler Enterprises Ltd.;;B Plus C 300mg Timed Release@@Vita Health Products Inc;;B Stress C + Iron & Vite@@Stanley Pharmaceuticals, A Division Of Vita Health Products Inc.;;B Totum 500@@Desbergers Lte, Division Of Technilab Inc.;;B Virol@@Rolmex International Inc.;;B Vitamin Compound With B12 Thunas@@Thuna Herbal Remedies Ltd.;;B With C 500 Cap@@Pharmetics (2011) Inc.;;B-1 Caps 500mg@@Twin Laboratories Inc.;;B-100 Caps@@Now Foods;;B-100 Complex Tablets@@Viva Pharmaceutical Inc.;;B-100 Hi Potency B Vitamins Tab@@Natrol, Inc.;;B-100 Vitamin Supplement@@Garden State Nutritionals;;B-50 Complex@@Vita Health Products Inc;;B-50 Complex Tab@@Vita Health Products Inc;;B-50 Hi Potency B Vitamins Tab@@Natrol, Inc.;;B-Combo@@Perdido Key Health And Wellness Inc;;B-complex@@Enrich International;;B-complex 100@@Great Earth Companies, Inc.;;B-complex 50@@Great Earth Companies, Inc.;;B-complex Tab@@Natures Sunshine Products, Inc.;;B-complex Tab@@Sant Naturelle (Ag) Lte;;B-complex Tablets@@Shaklee Corporation;;B-complex With Vitamin C, Biotin, Folic Acid@@Wn Pharmaceuticals Ltd.;;B-complex-50 Tab@@Jr Carlson Labs Inc;;B-plex@@Land Art Inc.;;B-plex@@Wn Pharmaceuticals Ltd.;;B-plex 100@@Merit Pharmaceuticals;;B-plus - Tab@@Champion's Choice Advanced Nutrition Inc.;;B1 400mg Ctr Tab@@Bioenergy Inc.;;B1 Tab 100mg@@Vita Health Products Inc;;B50 B Complex Tab@@Nutristar Health Products (1987) Inc.;;B50 Complex@@Preferred Nutrition Inc.;;B6 Plus Tab@@Vita Health Products Inc;;Bacmin@@Marnel Pharmaceuticals, Llc;;Bal-Care DHA@@Pru Gen Pharmaceuticals;;Bal-Care DHA Essential@@Pru Gen Pharmaceuticals;;Balanced B 125 Srt@@Anabolic Laboratories Inc.;;Balanced B-100 B-complex Vitamins Tab@@Pharmavite;;Balanced B-100 Timed Release@@Pharmavite;;Balanced B-50 B-complex Vitamins Tab@@Pharmavite;;Balanced B-50 B-complex Vitamins, Timed Rele@@Pharmavite;;Balanced B-50 Complex@@Leiner Health Products;;Balanced B-complex Vit + Vit C&e Tab@@Pharmavite;;Balanced B100@@Hall Laboratories, Ltd.;;Balanced B50 Complex@@Hall Laboratories, Ltd.;;Beminal Fortis Elx@@Whitehall Robins Inc.;;Beminal W C Fortis Inj@@Ayerst Laboratories;;Beminal With C Fortis Cap@@Wyeth Ayerst Canada Inc.;;Beminal With C Fortis Cap@@Whitehall Robins Inc.;;Beminal With C Fortis Pws@@Wyeth Ayerst Canada Inc.;;Betaxin@@Hospira, Inc.;;Betaxin Liq 100mg/ml@@Sanofi;;Bev 29 Tab@@Beverly International Nutrition;;Bev B-150@@Beverly International Nutrition;;Bewon Elixir@@Laboratoires Charton Laboratories;;Bewon Elixir 0.05mg/ml@@Wyeth Ayerst Canada Inc.;;Biovim Tab@@Le Naturiste J.M.B.

<DB00153>,<Ergocalciferol>,<approved;;nutraceutical>,<Ergocalciferol is an inactivated vitamin D analog. It is a form of vitamin synthesized by some plants in the presence of UVB light. The production of ergocalciferol was impulsed by the identification of dietary deficiency, more specifically vitamin D, as the main causative agent for rickets. Impulsed by this research, ergocalciferol was isolated for the first time from yeast in 1931 and its structure was elucidated in 1932.Ergocalciferol is considered the first vitamin D analog and it differentiates from  in the presence of a double bond between C22 and C23 and the presence of a methyl group at C24. These modifications reduce the affinity of ergocalciferol to vitamin D binding protein which derives in faster clearance, limits its activation and alters its catabolism.The first approved product containing ergocalciferol under the FDA records was developed by US Pharm Holdings and FDA approved in 1941.>,<CC(C)[C@@H](C)\C=C\[C@@H](C)[C@@]1([H])CC[C@@]2([H])\C(CCC[C@]12C)=C\C=C1\C[C@@H](O)CCC1=C>,<C28H44O>,<(3,5Z,7E,22E)-9,10-secoergosta-5,7,10(19),22-tetraen-3-ol;;(5Z,7E,22E)-(3S)-9,10-seco-5,7,10(19),22-ergostatetraen-3-ol;;(5Z,7E,22E)-(3S)-9,10-secoergosta-5,7,10(19),22-tetraen-3-ol;;Activated ergosterol;;Ercalciol;;Ergocalcifrol;;Ergocalciferol;;Ergocalciferolum;;Oleovitamin D2;;Viosterol;;Vitamin D2;;Vitamina D2>,<Aquasol A & D Drops@@Rhone Poulenc Rorer;;Cal/mag 2:1 With D@@Wn Pharmaceuticals Ltd.;;Calcium and Magnesium Citrate With Vitamin D@@Sisu Inc.;;Calcium Chelate Plus Vit D@@Hall Laboratories, Ltd.;;Calcium Citrate W Vitamin D Tab@@Nutri Dyn Products Ltd.;;Calcium Magnesium 2:1 Tablets With Vitamin D@@Sisu Inc.;;Calcium Magnesium Avec Vitamine D Et Zinc@@Les Aliments Nutri Source Inc.;;Calcium Magnesium Plus Vitamin D Liquid@@Jamp Pharma Corporation;;Calcium Mg and Zn Capsules With Vitamin D@@Rheingold Food International Ltd.;;Calcium With Vitamin D2@@Sisu Inc.;;Calcium With Vitamins C and D Tab@@Pure Life International Prods Inc.;;Children Pediatric Vitamins Drops@@Stanley Pharmaceuticals, A Division Of Vita Health Products Inc.;;Childrens Chewable Multiple Vitamins Tab@@Pharmavite;;D-forte@@Sandoz Canada Incorporated;;D-forte@@Euro Pharm International Canada Inc;;Deriton@@Nutrimetics International (Canada) Inc.;;Drisdol@@Sanofi Aventis;;Drisdol@@Avera McKennan Hospital;;Drisdol@@Validus Pharmaceuticals;;Drisdol@@Validus Pharmaceuticals LLC;;Ergocalciferol@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@Winthrop U.S.;;Ergocalciferol@@Sigma Pharm Laboratories, Llc;;Ergocalciferol@@Dispensing Solutions, Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@Unit Dose Services;;Ergocalciferol@@Carilion Materials Management;;Ergocalciferol@@Aidarex Pharmaceuticals LLC;;Ergocalciferol@@Ready Meds;;Ergocalciferol@@Banner Life Sciences Llc.;;Ergocalciferol@@Blenheim Pharmacal, Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@Av Kare, Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@Pd Rx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@Clinical Solutions Wholsesale;;Ergocalciferol@@Aphena Pharma Solutions Tennessee, Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@Nucare Pharmaceuticals,inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@Teva;;Ergocalciferol@@A-S Medication Solutions;;Ergocalciferol@@Lake Erie Medical Dba Quality Care Produts Llc;;Ergocalciferol@@Bionpharma Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@bryant ranch prepack;;Ergocalciferol@@Golden State Medical Supply, Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@Golden State Medical Supply Inc;;Ergocalciferol@@Alembic Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@St Marys Medical Park Pharmacy;;Ergocalciferol@@Proficient Rx LP;;Ergocalciferol@@KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITALS;;Ergocalciferol@@Rising Pharamceuticals, Inc;;Ergocalciferol@@Aphena Pharma Solutions - Tennessee, LLC;;Ergocalciferol@@American Health Packaging;;Ergocalciferol@@REMEDYREPACK INC.;;Ergocalciferol@@Nucare Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@St. Mary's Medical Park Pharmacy;;Ergocalciferol@@Virtus Pharmaceuticals;;Ergocalciferol@@Alvogen, Inc.;;Ergocalciferol@@Denton Pharma, Inc.

<DB00157>,<NADH>,<approved;;nutraceutical>,<NADH is the reduced form of NAD+, and NAD+ is the oxidized form of NADH, a coenzyme composed of ribosylnicotinamide 5'-diphosphate coupled to adenosine 5'-phosphate by pyrophosphate linkage. It is found widely in nature and is involved in numerous enzymatic reactions in which it serves as an electron carrier by being alternately oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH). It forms NADP with the addition of a phosphate group to the 2' position of the adenosyl nucleotide through an ester linkage.

<DB00158>,<Folic acid>,<approved;;nutraceutical;;vet_approved>,<Folic acid, also known as folate or Vitamin B9, is a member of the B vitamin family and an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, Folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, folic acid is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits .In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as  as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. When used in high doses such as for cancer therapy, or in low doses such as for Rheumatoid Arthritis or psoriasis,  impedes the body's ability to create folic acid. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of folic acid is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation.  (also known as folinic acid) supplementation is typically used for high-dose MTX regimens for the treatment of cancer. Levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), and are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF.There are also several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that are associated with reduced serum and red blood cell folate, including  (CBZ),  (PHT), or barbiturates . Folic acid is therefore often provided as supplementation to individuals using these medications, particularly to women of child-bearing age. Inadequate folate levels can result in a number of health concerns including cardiovascular disease, megaloblastic anemias, cognitive deficiencies, and neural tube defects (NTDs). Folic acid is typically supplemented during pregnancy to prevent the development of NTDs and in individuals with alcoholism to prevent the development of neurological disorders, for example.>,<NC1=NC(=O)C2=NC(CNC3=CC=C(C=C3)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(O)=O)C(O)=O)=CN=C2N1>,<C19H19N7O6>,<cido flico;;Folacin;;Folate;;Folic Acid;;Folsure;;N-[(4-{[(2-amino-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropteridin-6-yl)methyl]amino}phenyl)carbonyl]-L-glutamic acid;;N-pteroyl-L-glutamic acid;;PGA;;PteGlu;;Pteroyl-L-glutamate;;Pteroyl-L-glutamic acid;;Pteroyl-L-monoglutamic acid;;Pteroylglutamic acid;;Vitamin B9;;Vitamin Bc;;Vitamin M>,<24 Multivitamins + Minerals@@Stanley Pharmaceuticals, A Division Of Vita Health Products Inc.;;50 Plus@@Quest Vitamins A Div Of Purity Life Health Products;;50 Plus Multiple Vitamins & Minerals@@Gfr Pharma Ltd.;;A.R.T.H.

<DB00163>,<Vitamin E>,<approved;;nutraceutical;;vet_approved>,<In 1922, vitamin E was demonstrated to be an essential nutrient. Vitamin E is a term used to describe 8 different fat soluble tocopherols and tocotrienols, alpha-tocopherol being the most biologically active. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage. The antioxidant effects are currently being researched for use in the treatment of diseases causing bone loss, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and associated comorbidities, eye diseases, inflammatory diseases (including skin conditions), lipid disorders, neurological diseases, and radiation damage. Though this research is so far inconclusive, vitamin E remains a popular supplement and is generally considered safe by the FDA[FDA Label].>,<CC(C)CCC[C@@H](C)CCC[C@@H](C)CCC[C@]1(C)CCC2=C(O1)C(C)=C(C)C(O)=C2C>,<C29H50O2>,<(+)-a-tocopherol;;(2R,4'R,8'R)-a-tocopherol;;(2R)-2,5,7,8-TETRAMETHYL-2-[(4R,8R)-4,8,12-TRIMETHYLTRIDECYL]CHROMAN-6-OL;;(R,R,R)-a-tocopherol;;5,7,8-trimethyltocol;;alpha-tocopherol;;d-a-tocopherol>,<24 Multivitamins + Minerals@@Stanley Pharmaceuticals, A Division Of Vita Health Products Inc.;;50 Plus@@Quest Vitamins A Div Of Purity Life Health Products;;Aces Formula/formule A A S@@Quantofill Inc.;;Aces Tab@@Nu Life Nutrition Ltd.;;Acne C-Patch@@NeoBiotech Global Corporation;;Acti-copherols 200 Cap@@Acti Form Ltd.;;Acti-D Alphacopherol Cap 400unit@@Acti Form Ltd.;;Acti-D Alphacopherol Cap 800unit@@Acti Form Ltd.;;Advanced AM PM@@Trigen Laboratories, Inc.;;Am Caps@@New Vision Nutritionals Company;;Animal Shapes@@Central Texas Community Health Centers;;antistressSAN@@sanPharma GmbH;;Avon Nutrivance Vitamin E Plus@@Avon Products, Inc.;;Bear Essentials@@Health Asure, Inc.;;Beta-carotene 10,000 Iu With Vitamins C & E@@Jamieson Laboratories Ltd;;Bio-efa Borage Gla 240 Cap@@Pge Canada (86) Inc.;;Bio-efa Borage Gla 90 Cap@@Pge Canada (86) Inc.;;Bye Bye Burn Lot@@David D.

<DB00165>,<Pyridoxine>,<approved;;investigational;;nutraceutical;;vet_approved>,<Pyridoxine is the 4-methanol form of vitamin B6, an important water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. As its classification as a vitamin implies, Vitamin B6 (and pyridoxine) are essential nutrients required for normal functioning of many biological systems within the body. While many plants and microorganisms are able to synthesize pyridoxine through endogenous biological processes, animals must obtain it through their diet. More specifically, pyridoxine is converted to pyridoxal 5-phosphate in the body, which is an important coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, and aminolevulinic acid. It's important to note that Vitamin B6 is the collective term for a group of three related compounds, pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, and their phosphorylated derivatives, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. Although all six of these compounds should technically be referred to as vitamin B6, the term vitamin B6 is commonly used interchangeably with just one of them, pyridoxine . Vitamin B6, principally in its biologically active coenzyme form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is involved in a wide range of biochemical reactions, including the metabolism of amino acids and glycogen, the synthesis of nucleic acids, hemogloblin, sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids, and the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) . Pyridoxine is used medically for the treatment of vitamin B6 deficiency and for the prophylaxis of isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy (due to 's mechanism of action which competitively inhibits the action of pyridoxine in the above-mentioned metabolic functions). It is also used in combination with  (as the commercially available product Diclectin) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.>,<CC1=C(O)C(CO)=C(CO)C=N1>,<C8H11NO3>,<2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4,5-dihydroxymethylpyridine;;3-hydroxy-4,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpyridine;;3-hydroxy-4,5-dimethylol-a-picoline;;5-hydroxy-6-methyl-3,4-pyridinedimethanol;;Piridoxina;;Pyridoxine;;Pyridoxol;;Vitamin B6>,<24 Multivitamins + Minerals@@Stanley Pharmaceuticals, A Division Of Vita Health Products Inc.;;50 Plus@@Quest Vitamins A Div Of Purity Life Health Products;;50 Plus Multiple Vitamins & Minerals@@Gfr Pharma Ltd.;;A.R.T.H.

<DB00169>,<Cholecalciferol>,<approved;;nutraceutical>,<Vitamin D, in general, is a secosteroid generated in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol located there interacts with ultraviolet irradiation - like that commonly found in sunlight . Both the endogenous form of vitamin D (that results from 7-dehydrocholesterol transformation), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and the plant-derived form, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), are considered the main forms of vitamin d and are found in various types of food for daily intake . Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 . Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use .Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048]. However, studies are also ongoing to determine whether or not cholecalciferol may also play certain roles in cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and other medical conditions that may be associated with vitamin D deficiency .>,<CC(C)CCC[C@@H](C)[C@@]1([H])CC[C@@]2([H])\C(CCC[C@]12C)=C\C=C1\C[C@@H](O)CCC1=C>,<C27H44O>,<(+)-vitamin D3;;(3,5Z,7E)-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10(19)-trien-3-ol;;(5Z,7E)-(3S)-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10(19)-trien-3-ol;;Activated 7-dehydrocholesterol;;Calciol;;CC;;Cholecalciferol;;Colecalciferol;;Colecalciferolum;;Oleovitamin D3;;Vitamin D-3;;Vitamin D3>,<24 Multivitamins + Minerals@@Stanley Pharmaceuticals, A Division Of Vita Health Products Inc.;;50 Plus Multiple Vitamins & Minerals@@Gfr Pharma Ltd.;;A + D Ointment@@National Care Products Ltd.;;A.R.T.H.

Early symptoms of hypercalcemia may include weakness, fatigue, somnolence, headache, anorexia, dry mouth, metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, tinnitus, ataxia, and hypotonia [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Later and possibly more serious manifestation include nephrocalcinosis, renal dysfunction, osteoporosis in adults, impaired growth in children, anemia, metastatic calcification, pancreatitis, generalized vascular calcification, and seizures [F4027, F4042, F4048].Safety of doses in excess of 400 IU (10mcg) of vitamin D3 daily during pregnancy has not been established [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Maternal hypercalcemia, possibly caused by excessive vitamin D intake during pregnancy, has been associated with hypercalcemia in neonates, which may lead to supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome, the features of which may include retinopathy, mental or growth retardation, strabismus, and other effects [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Hypercalcemia during pregnancy may also lead to suppression of parathyroid hormone release in the neonate, resulting in hypocalcemia, tetany, and seizures [F4027, F4042, F4048].Vitamin D is deficient in maternal milk; therefore, breastfed infants may require supplementation. Use of excessive amounts of Vitamin D in nursing mothers may result in hypercalcemia in infants. Doses of Vitamin D3 in excess of 10 g daily should not be administered daily to nursing women. >,<DB01397@@Magnesium salicylate@@The serum concentration of Magnesium salicylate can be increased when

<DB00177>,<Valsartan>,<approved;;investigational>,<Valsartan is an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) that may be used to manage hypertension and heart failure. Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of valsartan in reducing blood pressure (BP) in many patient populations (including elderly, women, children, obese patients, patients with diabetes mellitus, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), patients at high risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asians) and in improving the clinical outcome in cardiovascular (CV) disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD) .Valsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Shortly after, in 1997, this drug was approved in the United States .This drug is generally well-tolerated with a side-effect profile superior to that of other antihypertensive drugs ,

<DB00178>,<Ramipril>,<approved>,<Ramipril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medications. It is metabolized to ramiprilat in the liver and, to a lesser extent, kidneys. Ramiprilat is a potent, competitive inhibitor of ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Ramipril may be used in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, nephropathy, and to reduce the rate of death, myocardial infarction and stroke in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events.>,<[H][C@@]12CCC[C@]1([H])N([C@@H](C2)C(O)=O)C(=O)[C@H](C)N[C@@H](CCC1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)OCC>,<C23H32N2O5>,<(2S-(1(R*(R*)),2alpha,3abeta,6abeta))-1-(2-((1-(Ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl)amino)-1-oxopropyl)octahydrocyclopenta(b)pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid;;Ramipril;;Ramiprilum>,<Ach-ramipril@@Accord Healthcare Limited;;Act Ramipril@@Actavis Pharma Company;;Ag-ramipril@@Angita Pharma Inc.;;Altace@@Valeant Canada Lp Valeant Canada S.E.C.;;Altace@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Altace@@King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Altace@@Lake Erie Medical Dba Quality Care Produts Llc;;Altace@@Pfizer Laboratories Div Pfizer Inc.;;Altace Cap 1.25mg@@Hoechst Roussel Canada Inc.;;Altace Cap 10mg@@Hoechst Roussel Canada Inc.;;Altace Cap 2.5mg@@Hoechst Roussel Canada Inc.;;Altace Cap 5mg@@Hoechst Roussel Canada Inc.;;Altace Hct@@Valeant Canada Lp Valeant Canada S.E.C.;;Altace Plus Felodipine 2.5mg + 2.5mg@@Sanofi Aventis;;Altace Plus Felodipine 5mg + 5mg@@Sanofi Aventis;;Apo-ramipril@@Apotex Corporation;;Apo-ramipril/hctz@@Apotex Corporation;;Auro-ramipril@@Auro Pharma Inc;;Ava-ramipril@@Avanstra Inc;;Bio-ramipril@@Biomed Pharma;;Dom-ramipril@@Dominion Pharmacal;;Ipg-ramipril@@Marcan Pharmaceuticals Inc;;Jamp-ramipril@@Jamp Pharma Corporation;;Mar-ramipril@@Marcan Pharmaceuticals Inc;;Mint-ramipril@@Mint Pharmaceuticals Inc;;Mylan-ramipril@@Mylan Pharmaceuticals;;Nra-ramipril@@Nora Pharma Inc;;Ntp-ramipril@@Nt Pharma Canada Ltd;;Pharma-ramipril@@Pharmascience Inc;;PMS-ramipril@@Pharmascience Inc;;PMS-ramipril-hctz@@Pharmascience Inc;;Priva-ramipril@@Pharmapar Inc;;Pro-ramipril - 1.25@@Pro Doc Limitee;;Pro-ramipril - 10@@Pro Doc Limitee;;Pro-ramipril - 2.5@@Pro Doc Limitee;;Pro-ramipril - 5@@Pro Doc Limitee;;Prv-ramipril@@Pharmapar Inc;;Ramace@@Sanofi Aventis;;Ramipril@@Sanis Health Inc;;Ramipril@@Cobalt Laboratories;;Ramipril@@Laboratoire Riva Inc;;Ramipril@@Sivem Pharmaceuticals Ulc;;Ramipril@@InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc;;Ramipril@@Rebel Distributors;;Ramipril@@Atlantic Biologicals Corps.;;Ramipril@@Camber Pharmaceuticals;;Ramipril@@Sandoz;;Ramipril@@Ranbaxy Inc.;;Ramipril@@Med Pharma Co., Ltd.;;Ramipril@@bryant ranch prepack;;Ramipril@@Dispensing Solutions, Inc.;;Ramipril@@Blu Pharmceuticals Llc;;Ramipril@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Ramipril@@Dr Reddy's Laboratories;;Ramipril@@Aidarex Pharmaceuticals LLC;;Ramipril@@Northwind Pharmaceuticals;;Ramipril@@Teva;;Ramipril@@Mesource Pharmaceuticals;;Ramipril@@Proficient Rx LP;;Ramipril@@Blenheim Pharmacal, Inc.;;Ramipril@@Unit Dose Services;;Ramipril@@Directrx;;Ramipril@@A-S Medication Solutions;;Ramipril@@Remedy Repack;;Ramipril@@Accord Healthcare Limited;;Ramipril@@Lake Erie Medical Dba Quality Care Produts Llc;;Ramipril@@Preferreed Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Ramipril@@Blue Point Laboratories;;Ramipril@@Lupin Pharmaceuticals;;Ramipril@@Apotex Corporation;;Ramipril@@Cardinal Health;;Ramipril@@Exelan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Ramipril@@Amerincan Health Packaging;;Ramipril@@Avera McKennan Hospital;;Ramipril@@Zydus Pharmaceuticals Usa, Inc.;;Ramipril@@Golden State Medical Supply;;Ramipril@@Carilion Materials Management;;Ramipril@@Av Kare, Inc.;;Ramipril@@West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp.;;Ramipril@@TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA;;Ramipril@@Actavis Pharma, Inc.;;Ramipril@@Aurobindo Pharma Limited;;Ramipril@@Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc.;;Ramipril@@Rising Health, Llc;;Ramipril@@Cadila Healthcare Limited;;Ramipril@@St. Mary's Medical Park Pharmacy;;Ramipril@@Lake Erie Medical DBA Quality Care Products LLC;;Ramipril@@PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Ramipril@@American Health Packaging;;Ramipril@@Preferred Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Ramipril@@Altamed Pharma;;Ramipril@@Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.;;Ramipril Capsules@@Ranbaxy Inc.;;Ramipril-10@@Sivem Pharmaceuticals Ulc;;Ramipril-2.5@@Sivem Pharmaceuticals Ulc;;Ramipril-5@@Sivem Pharmaceuticals Ulc;;Ramipril-hctz@@Pro Doc Limitee;;Ramipril-hctz@@Sanis Health Inc;;Ran-ramipril@@Ranbaxy Inc.;;Ran-ramipril Hctz@@Ranbaxy Inc.;;Ratio-ramipril@@Ratiopharm Inc Division Of Teva Canada Limited;;Rbx-ramipril@@Ranbaxy Inc.;;Sandoz Ramipril@@Sandoz Canada Incorporated;;Teva-ramipril@@Teva;;Teva-ramipril/hctz@@Teva;;Van-ramipril@@Vanc Pharmaceuticals Inc>,<L35JN3I7SJ>,<87333-19-5>,<Symptoms of overdose may include excessive peripheral vasodilation (with marked hypotension and shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure. Cases of ACE inhibitor induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in humans and presented as acute jaundice and elevated liver enzymes. Removal of the ACE inhbitor resulted in a decline in liver enzymes and re-challenge produced a subsequent increase. There were no observed tumerogenic effects at chronic doses up to 500mg/kg/day to rats for 24 months or at doses up to 1000mg/kg/day to mice for 18 months. For both species doses were administered by gavage and equivalent to 200 time the maximum recommended human exposure based on body surface area.No mutagenic activity was detected in the Ames test in bacteria, the micronucleus test in mice, unscheduled DNA synthesis in a human cell line, or a forward gene-mutation assay in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Several metabolites of ramipril also produced negative results in the Ames test.No effects on fertility were seen in rats at doses up to 500mg/kg/day. No teratogenicity was observed in rats and cynomolgus monkeys at doses 400 times the maximum recommended human exposure nor in rabbites at 2 times the maximum recommended human

<DB00182>,<Amphetamine>,<approved;;illicit;;investigational>,<Amphetamine, a compound discovered over 100 years ago, is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers. The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976.During World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.>,<CC(N)CC1=CC=CC=C1>,<C9H13N>,<(+-)-alpha-Methylphenylethylamine;;1-phenyl-2-aminopropane;;alpha-Methylbenzeneethaneamine;;Amfetamina;;Amfetamine;;Amfetaminum;;Amphetamine;;beta-Aminopropylbenzene;;beta-Phenylisopropylamin;;Desoxynorephedrine;;rac-(2R)-1-phenylpropan-2-amine;;rac-amphetamine;;a-methylbenzeneethaneamine;;a-methylphenethylamine;;-aminopropylbenzene;;-phenylisopropylamine>,<Act

<DB00187>,<Esmolol>,<approved>,<Esmolol, commonly marketed under the trade name Brevibloc, is a cardioselective beta-1 receptor blocker. It has a rapid onset but short duration of action without causing significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activities at recommended therapeutic doses. It works by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, which leads to decreased force and rate of heart contractions. Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: epinephrine and norepinephrine.>,<COC(=O)CCC1=CC=C(OCC(O)CNC(C)C)C=C1>,<C16H25NO4>,<()-esmolol;;()-methyl

<DB00188>,<Bortezomib>,<approved;;investigational>,<Bortezomib (originally PS-341 and marketed as Velcade by Millennium Pharmaceuticals) is the first therapeutic proteasome inhibitor to be tested in humans. The boron atom within bortezomib catalytically binds the active site of the 26S proteasome with high affinity and specificity, thereby resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In normal cells, the proteasome is involved in degradation of ubiquitylated proteins that have been tagged for destruction because they are damaged or unneeded by the cell. However, in cancerous cells, proteasome activity degrades pro-apoptotic proteins such as p53 that would normally result in programmed cell death of the dysfunctional cells. Proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib interrupt this process, resulting in destruction of cancerous cells. Bortezomib is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.>,<CC(C)C[C@H](NC(=O)[C@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(=O)C1=CN=CC=N1)B(O)O>,<C19H25BN4O4>,<[(1R)-3-methyl-1-({(2S)-3-phenyl-2-[(pyrazin-2-ylcarbonyl)amino]propanoyl}amino)butyl]boronic acid;;Bortezomib;;N-[(1R)-1-(DIHYDROXYBORYL)-3-methylbutyl]-N-(pyrazin-2-ylcarbonyl)-L-phenylalaninamide>,<Act Bortezomib@@Actavis Pharma Company;;Bortezomib@@Apotex Corporation;;Bortezomib@@Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC;;Bortezomib Accord@@Accord Healthcare Limited;;Bortezomib for Injection@@Teva;;Bortezomib for Injection@@Sandoz Canada Incorporated;;Bortezomib for Injection@@Dr Reddy's Laboratories;;Bortezomib for Injection@@Pfizer;;Bortezomib for Injection@@Mda Inc.;;Bortezomib Hospira@@Hospira, Inc.;;Bortezomib Sun@@Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (Europe) B.V.;;PMS-bortezomib@@Pharmascience Inc;;Velcade@@Janssen Pharmaceuticals;;Velcade@@Janssen Cilag International Nv;;Velcade@@Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.>,<69G8BD63PP>,<179324-69-7>,<Cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies in monkeys show that lethal IV doses are associated with decreases in blood pressure, increases in heart rate, increases in contractility, and ultimately terminal hypotension.

<DB00191>,<Phentermine>,<approved;;illicit>,<Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic agent and it was introduced in 1959 as part of an anti-obesity combination drug.[A174361, A174364] It is chemically related to amphetamine and it is commonly referred to as an atypical amphetamine. Phentermine has not been reported an addictive potential which allows this agent to be classified under the Schedule IV drugs (low abuse potential).Phentermine was FDA approved for short-term weight management in 1959 and it became widely used in 1960. This initial product, formed by the combination of phentermine with  and  was discontinued after finding several reports of abnormal valves in nearly 30% of the consumers.[A174376, T403] Later on, phentermine was approved alone and in combination with topiramate in 2012 as a new alternative that required lower doses of phentermine to obtain the desired effect.>,<CC(C)(N)CC1=CC=CC=C1>,<C10H15N>,<alpha,alpha-Dimethylphenethylamine;;Fentermina;;Phentermine;;Phentermine resin;;Phenterminum>,<Adipex-P@@A S Medication Solutions;;Adipex-P@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Adipex-P@@Teva Select Brands;;Adipex-P@@A-S Medication Solutions;;Adipex-P@@PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Fastin Cap 30mg@@Smithkline Beecham Pharma Division Of Smithkline Beecham Inc;;Ionamin@@Sanofi Aventis;;Ionamin@@UCB Manufacturing Inc;;Lomaira@@KVK-Tech, Inc.;;Lomaira@@bryant ranch prepack;;Phentermine@@Aurolife Pharma, LLC;;Phentermine@@A-S Medication Solutions;;Phentermine HCl@@Directrx;;Phentermine HCl@@Northwind Pharmaceuticals;;Phentermine HCl C-IV@@Direct_Rx;;Phentermine Hydrochloride@@Blenheim Pharmacal, Inc.;;Phentermine Hydrochloride@@Rebel Distributors;;Phentermine Hydrochloride@@Stat Rx USA;;Phentermine Hydrochloride@@Keltman Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Phentermine Hydrochloride@@Actavis Totowa LLC;;Phentermine Hydrochloride@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Phentermine Hydrochloride@@H.J.

Reports of acute overdose include restlessness, tremors, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations and panic state followed by fatigue, and depression. In the cardiovascular system, there are reports of tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension, hypotension, circulatory collapse. In the GI tract, there are symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. The management of acute overdosage includes symptomatic treatment as well as lavage and sedation with barbiturates.[FDA label]On the other hand, chronic overdosage is marked by dermatoses, insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. In severe cases, it can derive into a schizophrenia-like psychosis.[FDA label]Studies regarding the carcinogenic potential have not been performed.

(LD50)**: 1271 mg/kg (rat) **Overdose information**Fluconazole overdoses have been associated with hallucination and paranoia, sometimes in combination.[FDA label] In cases of overdose, employ supportive treatment. Gastric lavage may be necessary.[FDA label] Other modalities such as forced diuresis or hemodialysis may also be used.[FDA label]**A note on liver toxicity**The FDA label warns that this drug carries a risk of hepatotoxicity. Rare but serious cases of serious hepatic toxicity have been reported, especially in patients with serious underlying medical conditions using fluconazole.  This group of patients has an increased risk of fatality when using fluconazole.[FDA label]  In patients with existing liver dysfunction, use caution during fluconazole therapy. Those who are found to have abnormal liver function tests during therapy should be carefully monitored for the development of increasingly severe injury to the liver. Fluconazole should be stopped if its use is likely to be the underlying cause of liver injury, and medical attention should be sought.[FDA label,L6505] Fluconazole induced hepatotoxicity is usually reversible.[FDA label]**Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility**Fluconazole demonstrated no evidence of carcinogenic risk in mice and rats treated orally for 24 months at doses equivalent to approximately 2-7 time the recommended human dose). Male rats given fluconazole at doses equivalent to supratherapeutic human doses showed an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas. Cytogenetic studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated no sign of chromosomal mutation. The significance of these findings for humans is unknown.[FDA label]**Use in pregnancy**There are no sufficient and well-controlled studies of fluconazole use in pregnant women. Available human data do not show an increased risk of congenital anomalies after pregnant women were treated with standard doses (<200 mg/day) of fluconazole, either in a single dose or multiple doses in the first trimester did not appear to impact the fetus negatively.[FDA label] Several case reports describe rare but striking congenital anomalies observed in infants who were exposed to fluconazole at high doses reaching 400-800 mg/day, primarily in the first trimester of pregnancy. Similar findings were observed in animal studies. If this drug is administered during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking fluconazole, the risk should be discussed thoroughly.[FDA label]**Use in nursing**Fluconazole is secreted in breastmilk at high concentrations. Exercise caution if this drug is used during nursing.[FDA label]>,<DB08870@@Brentuximab vedotin@@The serum concentration of Brentuximab vedotin can be increased when it is combined with

<DB00198>,<Oseltamivir>,<approved>,<Oseltamivir (also known as the marketed product Tamiflu<U+24C7>), is an antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor used for the treatment and prophylaxis of infection with influenza viruses A and B. Oseltamivir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the activity of the viral neuraminidase enzyme which is found on the surface of the viral, which is essential for viral replication and infectivity.Notably, in 2017, the World Health Organization downgraded oseltamivir from its essential medicines list from a "core" drug to a "complementary" drug, due to limited cost-effectiveness.Oseltamivir is an acetamido cyclohexene that is a structural homolog of sialic acid and inhibits neuraminidase. Developed by Roche and approved in 1999, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) that elicits its antiviral action by preventing both influenza A and influenza B from budding from the host cell . Additional approved NAIs include GlaxoSmithKlines Relenza (zanamivir) and Seqirus Rapivab (peramivir) . Although such NAIs are only effective if administered within 48hrs of symptom onset, they have demonstrated the ability to shorten the duration of influenza symptoms, with earlier treatment generally yielding better results . Especially given the appearance of contemporary generic alternatives, oseltamivir remains a popular and demonstrably effective and successful influenza antiviral, particularly as an element in various national and community pandemic action plans.>,<CCOC(=O)C1=C[C@@H](OC(CC)CC)[C@H](NC(C)=O)[C@@H](N)C1>,<C16H28N2O4>,<(-)-oseltamivir;;1-Cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid, 4-(acetylamino)-5-amino-3-(1-ethylpropoxy)-, ethyl ester, (3R-(3alpha,4beta,5alpha))-;;Ethyl (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(1-ethylpropoxy)-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate;;Oseltamivir;;Osltamivir;;Oseltamivirum>,<Ebilfumin@@Actavis Group Ptc Ehf.;;Mylan-oseltamivir@@Mylan Pharmaceuticals;;Nat-oseltamivir@@Natco Pharma Limited;;Oseltamavir Phosphate@@Preferreed Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Oseltamavir Phosphate@@Rpk Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Oseltamavir Phosphate@@Proficient Rx LP;;Oseltamavir Phosphate@@REMEDYREPACK INC.;;Oseltamavir Phosphate@@Nucare Pharmaceuticals,inc.;;Oseltamavir Phosphate@@Macleods Pharmaceuticals Limited;;Oseltamivir@@Alembic Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Oseltamivir@@Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Nucare Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@McKesson Packaging Services;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Remedy Repack;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Aidarex Pharmaceuticals LLC;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Nucare Pharmaceuticals,inc.;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Camber Pharmaceuticals;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Preferreed Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Strides Shasun Limited;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Northstar RxLLC;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@A-S Medication Solutions;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Rpk Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc.;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Preferred Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Oseltamivir phosphate@@Preferred Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Oseltamivir phosphate@@Proficient Rx LP;;Oseltamivir phosphate@@A-S Medication Solutions;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Alvogen Inc.;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@AvKARE, Inc.;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Oseltamivir phosphate@@Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Oseltamivir Phosphate@@Amneal Pharmaceuticals NY LLC;;Oseltamivir Phosphate for Oral Suspension@@Alvogen Inc.;;Tamiflu@@Hoffmann La Roche;;Tamiflu@@Roche Registration Gmb H;;Tamiflu@@Rebel Distributors;;Tamiflu@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Tamiflu@@Dispensing Solutions, Inc.;;Tamiflu@@A-S Medication Solutions;;Tamiflu@@Remedy Repack;;Tamiflu@@Gilead Sciences, Inc.;;Tamiflu@@Genentech, Inc.;;Tamiflu@@REMEDYREPACK INC.;;Tamiflu Capsule 75mg@@Hoffmann La Roche;;Tamiflu Oral Suspension@@Hoffmann La Roche>,<20O93L6F9H>,<196618-13-0>,<Reports of overdoses with oseltamivir have been received from clinical trials and during postmarketing experience [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115].

In case of overdosage, erythromycin should immediately be discontinued. Prompt elimination of unabsorbed erythromycin should be attempted, and all other appropriate supportive measures should be initiated.Erythromycin is not removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis [FDA label].**Hepatotoxicity**:Erythromycin can cause hepatic dysfunction, cholestatic jaundice, and abnormal liver transaminases, particularly when _erythromycin estolate_ is administered .**A note on pseudomembranous colitis**: Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with most antibacterial agents, including erythromycin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, the physician should consider this diagnosis in patients who with diarrhea after the administration of antibacterial agents [FDA label].**Pregnancy**: This drug is classified as pregnancy category B: There is no evidence of teratogenicity or any other adverse effect on reproduction in female rats fed erythromycin base (up to 0.25% of diet) before and during mating, during gestation, and through weaning of two successive litters. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always representative of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if it absolutely necessary [FDA label]. It is important to note that _erythromycin estolate_ is contraindicated in pregnancy .**Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility**: Long-term oral studies in rats with erythromycin ethylsuccinate and erythromycin base did not show evidence of tumorigenicity. Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted to this date. There was no apparent effect on male or female fertility in rats fed erythromycin (base) at levels up to 0.25% of diet [FDA label].**Nursing Mothers**: Erythromycin appears in breast milk at levels which are approximately 50% of the plasma concentration .

<DB00201>,<Caffeine>,<approved>,<A methylxanthine naturally occurring in some beverages and also used as a pharmacological agent. Caffeine's most notable pharmacological effect is as a central nervous system stimulant, increasing alertness and producing agitation. It also relaxes smooth muscle, stimulates cardiac muscle, stimulates diuresis, and appears to be useful in the treatment of some types of headache. Several cellular actions of caffeine have been observed, but it is not entirely clear how each contributes to its pharmacological profile. Among the most important are inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, antagonism of adenosine receptors, and modulation of intracellular calcium handling.>,<CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C)C(=O)N2C>,<C8H10N4O2>,<1-methyltheobromine;;1,3,7-trimethyl-2,6-dioxopurine;;1,3,7-trimethylpurine-2,6-dione;;1,3,7-trimethylxanthine;;3,7-Dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl-1H-purin-2,6-dion;;7-methyltheophylline;;Anhydrous caffeine;;Cafena;;Cafine;;Caffeinum;;Coffein;;Coffeinum;;Guaranine;;Koffein;;Matena;;Methyltheobromine;;Tena;;Thein;;Theine>,<(extra Strength) Acetaminophen, Caffeine & 8mg Codeine Phosphate Caplets@@Stanley Pharmaceuticals, A Division Of Vita Health Products Inc.;;217@@Merck Frosst Canada & Cie, Merck Frosst Canada & Co.;;217 Strong Tab@@Merck Frosst Canada & Cie, Merck Frosst Canada & Co.;;222 Tablets@@Mcneil Consumer Healthcare Division Of Johnson & Johnson Inc;;282 Mep Tab@@Merck Frosst Canada & Cie, Merck Frosst Canada & Co.;;282 Tab@@Merck Frosst Canada & Cie, Merck Frosst Canada & Co.;;282 Tablets@@Pendopharm Division Of De Pharmascience Inc;;292 Tab@@Merck Frosst Canada & Cie, Merck Frosst Canada & Co.;;292 Tablets@@Pendopharm Division Of De Pharmascience Inc;;357 Super Magnum@@King Richard Promotions Dba Dbi;;4229 First Aid Kit@@Honeywell Safety Products USA, Inc;;4248 First Aid Kit@@Honeywell Safety Products USA, Inc;;4346 First Aid Kit@@Honeywell Safety Products USA, Inc;;692 Tab@@Merck Frosst Canada & Cie, Merck Frosst Canada & Co.;;692 Tablet@@Lioh Inc.;;7 Select Migraine Formula@@7 Eleven;;999 GANMAOLING Cold@@Kingsway;;A & C Tablets With Codeine 15mg@@D.C.

<DB00203>,<Sildenafil>,<approved;;investigational>,<In eliciting its mechanism of action, sildenafil ultimately prevents or minimizes the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhibiting cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s . Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 , continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer's brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries .>,<CCCC1=NN(C)C2=C1NC(=NC2=O)C1=C(OCC)C=CC(=C1)S(=O)(=O)N1CCN(C)CC1>,<C22H30N6O4S>,<1-((3-(4,7-Dihydro-1-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-1H-pyrazolo(4,3-d)pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)-4-methylpiperazine;;Sildenafil;;Sildenafilo>,<Accel-sildenafil@@Accel Pharma Inc;;Act Sildenafil@@Actavis Pharma Company;;Ag-sildenafil@@Angita Pharma Inc.;;Apo-sildenafil@@Apotex Corporation;;Apo-sildenafil R@@Apotex Corporation;;Auro-sildenafil@@Auro Pharma Inc;;Bio-sildenafil@@Biomed Pharma;;Dom-sildenafil@@Dominion Pharmacal;;Gd-sildenafil@@Genmed A Division Of Pfizer Canada Inc;;Ipg-sildenafil@@Marcan Pharmaceuticals Inc;;Jamp-sildenafil@@Jamp Pharma Corporation;;Jamp-sildenafil R@@Jamp Pharma Corporation;;M-sildenafil@@Mantra Pharma Inc;;Mar-sildenafil@@Marcan Pharmaceuticals Inc;;Mint-sildenafil@@Mint Pharmaceuticals Inc;;Myl-sildenafil@@Mylan Pharmaceuticals;;Mylan-sildenafil@@Mylan Pharmaceuticals;;Nra-sildenafil@@Nora Pharma Inc;;Pb-sildenafil@@Pb Pharma Inc;;PMS-sildenafil@@Pharmascience Inc;;PMS-sildenafil R@@Pharmascience Inc;;Priva-sildenafil@@Pharmapar Inc;;Prv-sildenafil@@Pharmapar Inc;;Prz-sildenafil@@Pharmaris Canada Inc;;Ran-sildenafil@@Ranbaxy Inc.;;Ratio-sildenafil@@Teva;;Revatio@@Pfizer;;Revatio@@Pfizer Europe Ma Eeig;;Revatio@@Cardinal Health;;Revatio@@Pfizer Laboratories Div Pfizer Inc;;Riva-sildenafil@@Laboratoire Riva Inc;;Sandoz Sildenafil@@Sandoz Canada Incorporated;;Sildenafil@@Pharmascience Inc;;Sildenafil@@Sanis Health Inc;;Sildenafil@@Pro Doc Limitee;;Sildenafil@@Sivem Pharmaceuticals Ulc;;Sildenafil@@Methapharm, Inc.;;Sildenafil@@Jamp Pharma Corporation;;Sildenafil@@Actavis Pharma Company;;Sildenafil@@bryant ranch prepack;;Sildenafil@@Northwind Pharmaceuticals;;Sildenafil@@Amerincan Health Packaging;;Sildenafil@@Preferreed Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Sildenafil@@A-S Medication Solutions;;Sildenafil@@Remedy Repack;;Sildenafil@@North Star Rx Llc;;Sildenafil@@Directrx;;Sildenafil@@Nucare Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Sildenafil@@Aidarex Pharmaceuticals LLC;;Sildenafil@@Auro Medics Pharma Llc;;Sildenafil@@H.

Doses of 200 mg did not result in increased efficacy but the incidence of adverse reaction (headache, flushing, dizziness, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, altered vision) was increased [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].Due to the lack of data on the effect of sildenafil indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in pregnant women, sildenafil is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless also using appropriate contraceptive measures [F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. The safety and efficacy of sildenafil indicated for treating PAH in a woman during labor and delivery have not been studied [F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Caution should ultimately be exercised when sildenafil is administered to nursing women as it is not known if sildenafil or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk [F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].The safety and efficacy of sildenafil for the treatment of PAH in children below 1 year of age has not been established as no data is available .Clinical experience with the elderly population in the use of sildenafil for the treatment of PAH has been varied. Some reports suggest that there are no identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients  while others have documented that clinical efficacy as measured by 6-minute walk distance could be less in elderly patients . In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .Conversely, when sildenafil was used to treat erectile dysfunction in healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over), a reduced clearance of sildenafil was observed [F3853, L5611]. This reduction resulted in about 90% higher plasma concentrations of sildenafil and the active N-desmethyl metabolite compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers (18-45 years) [F3853, L5611]. Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in free sildenafil plasma concentration was approximately 40% [F3853, L5611].Sildenafil was not carcinogenic when administered to rats for 24 months at a dose resulting in total systemic drug exposure (AUCs) for unbound sildenafil and its major metabolite of 29- and 42- times, for male and female rats, respectively, the exposures observed in human males given the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 100 mg [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil was not carcinogenic when administered to mice for 18-21 months at dosages up to the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 10 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].Sildenafil was negative in in vitro bacterial and Chinese hamster ovary cell assays to detect mutagenicity, and in vitro human lymphocytes and in vivo mouse micronucleus assays to detect clastogenicity [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].There was no impairment of fertility in rats given sildenafil up to 60 mg/kg/day for 36 days to females and 102 days to males, a dose producing an AUC value of more than 25 times the human male AUC [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].>,<DB08870@@Brentuximab vedotin@@The

<DB00207>,<Azithromycin>,<approved>,<Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half-life and a high degree of tissue penetration . It was initially approved by the FDA in 1991 .It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin .Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides .>,<CC[C@H]1OC(=O)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O[C@H]2C[C@@](C)(OC)[C@@H](O)[C@H](C)O2)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O[C@@H]2O[C@H](C)C[C@@H]([C@H]2O)N(C)C)[C@](C)(O)C[C@@H](C)CN(C)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O)[C@]1(C)O>,<C38H72N2O12>,<Azithromycin;;Azithromycine;;Azithromycinum;;Azitromicina>,<Act Azithromycin@@Actavis Pharma Company;;Ag-azithromycin@@Angita Pharma Inc.;;Apo-azithromycin@@Apotex Corporation;;Apo-azithromycin Z@@Apotex Corporation;;Auro-azithromycin@@Auro Pharma Inc;;Ava-azithromycin@@Avanstra Inc;;AzaSITE@@Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;AzaSITE@@Insite Vision Incorporated;;AzaSite@@Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;AzaSITE@@Akorn;;Azithromycin@@Pharmascience Inc;;Azithromycin@@Dominion Pharmacal;;Azithromycin@@Sanis Health Inc;;Azithromycin@@Cobalt Laboratories;;Azithromycin@@Sivem Pharmaceuticals Ulc;;Azithromycin@@4513347 Canada Inc.;;Azithromycin@@Kaiser Foundations Hospitals;;Azithromycin@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Azithromycin@@Mylan Pharmaceuticals;;Azithromycin@@Dispensing Solutions, Inc.;;Azithromycin@@Rebel Distributors;;Azithromycin@@Wockhardt;;Azithromycin@@TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.;;Azithromycin@@Med Vantx, Inc.;;Azithromycin@@Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc.;;Azithromycin@@Stat Rx USA;;Azithromycin@@Cardinal Health;;Azithromycin@@Pd Rx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Azithromycin@@H.J.

Macrolide resistance is also an ongoing issue . Hepatotoxicity has been since in rare cases . **A note on the risk of liver toxicity**:Due to the act that  azithromycin is mainly eliminated by the liver, caution should be observed when azithromycin is given to patients with decreased hepatic function [FDA label]. **A note on potential renal toxicity**:Because limited data in patients with renal GFR <10 mL/min, caution should be exercised when prescribing azithromycin to these patients [FDA label].**Use in Pregnancy**:This drug is categorized as a pregnancy category B drug. Reproduction studies have been done in rats and mice at doses up to moderately maternally toxic doses (for example, 200 mg/kg/day). These doses, based on a mg/m2 basis, are approximately 4 and 2 times, respectively, the human daily dose of 500 mg. In the animal studies, no harmful effects to the fetus due to azithromycin were observed. There are, at this time, no conclusive and well-controlled studies that have been done in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies do not always predict human response, azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed [FDA label].**Nursing Mothers**: It is unknown at this time whether azithromycin is excreted in human milk. Because many other drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be observed when azithromycin is given to a nursing woman [FDA label].**Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility**: Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to study carcinogenic potential. Azithromycin has demonstrated no potential to be mutagenic in standard laboratory tests.

<DB00208>,<Ticlopidine>,<approved>,<Ticlopidine is an effective inhibitor of platelet aggregation. It is a prodrug that is metabolised to an active form, which blocks the ADP receptor that is involved in GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation leading to platelet aggregation. Ticlopidine is marketed under the brand name Ticlid and is indicated for patients who cannot take aspirin or in whom aspirin has not worked to prevent a thrombotic stroke. The FDA label includes a black-box warning of neutropenia, aplastic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, and agranulocytosis, so it is necessary to monitor patients' WBC and platelets when they are taking ticlopidine.>,<ClC1=CC=CC=C1CN1CCC2=C(C1)C=CS2>,<C14H14ClNS>,<Ticlopidina;;Ticlopidine;;Ticlopidinum>,<Alti-ticlopidine - Tab 250mg@@Altimed Pharma Inc.;;Dom-ticlopidine@@Dominion Pharmacal;;Mylan-ticlopidine@@Mylan Pharmaceuticals;;Nu-ticlopidine 250 mg@@Nu Pharm Inc;;PMS-ticlopidine@@Pharmascience Inc;;Sandoz Ticlopidine@@Sandoz Canada Incorporated;;Teva-ticlopidine@@Teva;;Ticlid@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Ticlid@@Genentech, Inc.;;Ticlid 250mg Tablets@@Hoffmann La Roche;;Ticlid Tab 250mg@@Syntex Inc.;;Ticlopidine@@Sanis Health Inc;;Ticlopidine@@Aa Pharma Inc;;Ticlopidine Hydrochloride@@Eon Labs, Inc.;;Ticlopidine Hydrochloride@@Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd.;;Ticlopidine Hydrochloride@@Av Kare, Inc.;;Ticlopidine Hydrochloride@@Genpharm Ulc;;Ticlopidine Hydrochloride@@Teva;;Ticlopidine Hydrochloride@@Carilion Materials Management;;Ticlopidine hydrochloride@@Apotex Corporation;;Ticlopidine-250@@Pro Doc Limitee>,<OM90ZUW7M1>,<55142-85-3>,<Single oral doses of ticlopidine at 1600 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg were lethal to rats and mice, respectively.

<DB00213>,<Pantoprazole>,<approved>,<Pantoprazole is a first-generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including , , and , for example . Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including , , , , and .Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours [FDA Label].Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life .PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion .>,<COC1=C(OC)C(CS(=O)C2=NC3=C(N2)C=C(OC(F)F)C=C3)=NC=C1>,<C16H15F2N3O4S>,<Pantoprazol;;Pantoprazole;;Pantoprazolum>,<Abbott-pantoprazole@@Abbott;;Act Pantoprazole@@Actavis Pharma Company;;Ag-pantoprazole@@Angita Pharma Inc.;;Ag-pantoprazole Sodium@@Angita Pharma Inc.;;Apo-pantoprazole@@Apotex Corporation;;Auro-pantoprazole@@Auro Pharma Inc;;Ava-pantoprazole@@Avanstra Inc;;Bio-pantoprazole@@Biomed Pharma;;Controloc Control@@Takeda;;Dom-pantoprazole@@Dominion Pharmacal;;Ipg-pantoprazole@@Marcan Pharmaceuticals Inc;;Jamp-pantoprazole@@Jamp Pharma Corporation;;M-pantoprazole@@Mantra Pharma Inc;;Mar-pantoprazole@@Marcan Pharmaceuticals Inc;;Mint-pantoprazole@@Mint Pharmaceuticals Inc;;Mylan-pantoprazole@@Mylan Pharmaceuticals;;Mylan-pantoprazole T@@Mylan Pharmaceuticals;;Ntp-pantoprazole@@Nt Pharma Canada Ltd;;Pantecta Control@@Takeda;;Panto IV@@Takeda;;Panto-byk@@Nycomed;;Pantoloc@@Takeda;;Pantoloc Control@@Takeda;;Pantoprazole@@Pro Doc Limitee;;Pantoprazole@@Sanis Health Inc;;Pantoprazole@@Laboratoire Riva Inc;;Pantoprazole@@Pharmascience Inc;;Pantoprazole@@Meliapharm Inc;;Pantoprazole@@Sorres Pharma Inc;;Pantoprazole@@Dominion Pharmacal;;Pantoprazole@@Ranbaxy Inc.;;Pantoprazole@@Sivem Pharmaceuticals Ulc;;Pantoprazole@@Cobalt Laboratories;;Pantoprazole@@Altamed Pharma;;Pantoprazole@@Nora Pharma Inc;;Pantoprazole@@State of Florida DOH Central Pharmacy;;Pantoprazole@@Legacy Pharmaceutical Packaging;;Pantoprazole@@Major;;Pantoprazole@@Cardinal Health;;Pantoprazole@@Dr.Reddy's Laboratories Limited;;Pantoprazole for Injection@@Fresenius Kabi;;Pantoprazole for Injection@@Teva;;Pantoprazole for Injection@@Auro Pharma Inc;;Pantoprazole Magnesium@@Altius Healthcare Inc;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Wockhardt;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Rebel Distributors;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Av Kare, Inc.;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Physicians Total Care, Inc.;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Sun Pharma Global FZE;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Aphena Pharma Solutions Tennessee, Inc.;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@bryant ranch prepack;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Ready Meds;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@State of Florida DOH Central Pharmacy;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Rxchange Co;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Directrx;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Amerincan Health Packaging;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Ranbaxy Inc.;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Safecor Health, LLC;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Mesource Pharmaceuticals;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Orchid Pharma Inc;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Ncs Health Care Of Ky, Inc Dba Vangard Labs;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@A-S Medication Solutions;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Avera McKennan Hospital;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Akorn;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Remedy Repack;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Actavis Pharma Company;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Legacy Pharmaceutical Packaging;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Lake Erie Medical Dba Quality Care Produts Llc;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Nucare Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Nucare Pharmaceuticals,inc.;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Unit Dose Services;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Preferreed Pharmaceuticals Inc.;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Contract Pharmacy Services Pa;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Northwind Pharmaceuticals;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Camber Pharmaceuticals;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@California Pharmaceuticals, Llc;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Clinical Solutions Wholsesale;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Red Pharm Drug, Inc.;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Cardinal Health;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@St. Marys Medical Park Pharmacy;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Major;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Rpk Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@California Pharmaceutical, Llc;;Pantoprazole sodium@@Macleods Pharmaceuticals Limited;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Auro Medics Pharma Llc;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Amneal Pharmaceuticals;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Aidarex Pharmaceuticals LLC;;Pantoprazole Sodium@@Denton Pharma, Inc.

In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and its administration lead to rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown at this time .**Teratogenic Effects**This drug falls under pregnancy category B category. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 88 times the recommended human dose (RHD), as well as in rabbits at oral doses up to 16 times the RHD, and have shown no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus caused by pantoprazole. No adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have been completed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should only be used during pregnancy if clearly required .**Nursing Mothers**Pantoprazole and its metabolites have been found to be excreted in the milk of rats. Pantoprazole excretion in human milk has been found in a study performed with a single nursing mother after one 40 mg oral dose. The clinical relevance of this finding is not known, however, it is advisable to take note of this finding when considering pantoprazole use during nursing.
